        Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae. They are classified
        as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans. Although only eight species of
        bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing in a wide variety of
        habitats throughout the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the
        Southern Hemisphere.
